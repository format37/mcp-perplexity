# Project overview
Perplexity MCP server that aimed to help search and research web

We have example that we need to copy to this project:

The specific of our MCP servers is that each tool should save CSV and return standartized formatted responce, including csv forlder, head and python read example.

Our new base MCP implementatino should have simple test function, py_eval.
We sould implement perplexity search tools on the next stage.
